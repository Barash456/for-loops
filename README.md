# Power of 2

*(Implement a program in the directory `power-of-2`)*

 A user provides an integer `n` as an input. Write a program that determines if
`n` is a power of 2. In this case, print the power value.

Examples:

```
The program determines if a number is a power of 2.
Enter the number: 8
8 = 2^3
```

```
The program determines if a number is a power of 2.
Enter the number: 6
6 is not a power of 2.
```

# Power of k

*(Implement a program in the directory `power-of-k`)*

A user provides two integers `n` and `k` as an input. Write a program that
determins if `n` is a power of `k`. In this case, print the power value.

Examples:

```
The program determines if a number n is a power of k.
Enter n and k: 64 4
64 = 4^3
```

```
The program determines if a number n is a power of k.
Enter n and k: 64 8
64 = 8^2
```

```
The program determines if a number n is a power of k.
Enter n and k: 9 2
9 is not a power of 2.
```

# Prime number

*(Implement a program in the directory `prime-number`)*

A user provides an integer `n` as an input. Write a program that determinees if
`n` is a prime number.

Examples:

```
The program determines if an integer is prime.
Enter the number: 2
2 is a prime number.
```

```
The program determines if an integer is prime.
Enter the number: 4
4 is not a prime number.
```

# Perfect square

*(Implement a program in the directory `perfect-square`)*

A user provides an integer `n` as an input. Write a program that determines if
`n` is a perfect square, i.e. there exists an integer `k`, such that `k^2 = N`.
The program must print `k`, if `n` is a perfect square.

Examples:

```
The program determines if an integer is a perfect square.
Enter the number: 9
9 is a perfect square. 3^2 = 9
```

```
The program determines if an integer is a perfect square.
Enter the number: 8
8 is not a perfect square.
```

# First digit

*(Implement a program in the directory `first-digit`)*

A user provides an integer as an input. Write a program that prints the first
digit of the number.

Examples:

```
The program prints the first digit of the given integer.
Enter the number: 2147
The first digit is 2
```

```
The program prints the first digit of the given integer.
Enter the number: 0
The first digit is 0
```

# Reversed number

*(Implement a program in the directory `reversed-number`)*

A user provides an integer as an input. Write a program that reverses the
digits in the integer.

Examples:

```
The program reverses the digits in the number.
Enter the number: 123
The reversed number is 321
```

```
The program reverses the digits in the number.
Enter the number: 1
The reversed number is 1
```

# Even digits


*(Implement a program in the directory `even-digits`)*

A user provides an integer as an input. Write a program that determines if all
digits in the integer are even.

Examples:

```
The program determines if all digits in the integer are even.
Enter the number: 2860
All digits in 2860 are even.
```

```
The program determines if all digits in the integer are even.
Enter the number: 2816
Not all digits in 2816 are even.
```
